      <h2>About Learning Landscape</h2>
      <!-- stuff -->
      <section class="with_sidebar">
        <article>
          <p>Our project is to create a massively multiplayer online (MMO) “educational” game. Unlike most of today’s educational games, our game will not only focus on the learning but also on rich gameplay. The players will be able to gain knowledge of their disciplines of interest by progressing in our game and by exploring different areas of study. The game features a landscape that is initially built based on an online academic database.</p>
          <p>As players become proficient in an area of study they can contribute to that specific area by offering one on one tutoring, adding custom challenges to the landscape, or uploading educational videos. The overall goal of the game is to not be an educational game, but a game that is educational.</p>
          <h3>Ideas</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Features a 3D landscape featuring different locations categorized by subject. The elevation of the terrain is correlated with complexity of the course. In other words, areas of higher elevation are restricted until the players overcome a certain requirement of challenges found in lower areas.
              <ul>
                <li>However, the terrain does not necessarily have to be of higher altitude. It could be any kind of restricted area. i.e “To enter the Mythical Temple of Calculus you must complete at least x algebra challenges and y precalc challenges.”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A criteria-based matchmaking system that can match you with fellow students, tutors, or mentors. </li>
            <li>Massively multiplayer events including competitions, contests, boss battles etc.</li>
            <li>Leaderboard with a ranking system. Higher ranking players have the opportunity to receive academic awards such as grants and scholarships to real universities and institutions. If the game gets enough recognition, we might be able to reward players with diplomas or GEDs.</li>
            <li>Gameplay rewards in terms of cosmetics, items, skills, and secret areas to keep the players engaged. These will act as an incentive for the players to advance in the game.</li>
            <li>Different games targeted at different age groups. (It could just be one game split into parts).</li>
            <li>An academic skill tree that could be predetermined according to your needs. For instance, if a 6th grader may choose to become a mechanical engineer, our system will suggest the best academic path that he or she may follow. This path will include skills and knowledge that is required to be an engineer. This can allow the student to concentrate on their area of study, instead of having to learn material not pertinent to their career choice.
              <ul>
                <li>This is similar to a class system seen in role playing games (RPGs). The player chooses what kind of character they want to be. As they progress through the game they learn skills and use tools that will help them become what they aspire to be. For example, a player may choose to become a warrior, and will follow a “career path” that will provide the player with necessary skills and items they need to become a warrior.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Multiplatform support so that players can keep track of their progress and ranking on mobile devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Users will be able to delve<sup>1</sup> into rich, rewarding gameplay </li>
            <li>They can then use these item and skills in the game where learning might not take place</li>
            <li>This encourages learning so that they can advance further in the game</li>
            <li>Users can complete objectives, puzzles, and missions given by NPCs (Non-playable characters)</li>
            <li>Users can compete with other users directly with the use of “competitive challenge courses”</li>
            <li>Users can explore caves, mountains, and dungeons in order to find items that require actual learning problems to be solved</li>
          </ul>
